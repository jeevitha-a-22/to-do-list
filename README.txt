# To Do List Web Page

# Project Overview
-To-Do List Web Page is a lightweight web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, designed to help users manage daily tasks in an easy and intuitive manner. The goal is to provide a clean, responsive, and accessible interface while applying core front-end development principles including DOM manipulation, event handling, state persistence, and responsive design.

# Objectives
-Build a user-friendly To-Do List web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
-Allow users to add, edit, mark as done/undone, and delete tasks
-(Optionally) Persist tasks so they remain after page reload
-Provide a clean, responsive, accessible interface

# Pages/Sections 
-Header: app name or logo (and optional nav)
-Task Input Section: text input + “Add” button
-Task List Section: dynamic list of tasks, each with Edit / Delete / toggle completion
-Footer: credits, links, or tagline

# Design Guidelines
-Use a neutral light background.
-Present tasks in white “cards” or rows with subtle shadows or borders
-Legible sans-serif font (e.g. Arial, Roboto)
-Strong contrast for readability (text vs background)
-Hover and focus effects for buttons and interactive elements
-Responsiveness: input and buttons flow nicely on small screens
-Consistent spacing (padding, margins)
-Modest CSS transitions for add/delete animations

# Technical Requirements
- HTML5 structure.
- CSS styling and basic animations.
- JavaScript + jQuery for logic: adding, editing, deleting, toggling tasks
